This is an example of how to use the twitter client with Authn and Django.

The dependencies are managed with poetry, so you may need to install that: https://python-poetry.org/docs.

You can start the server with `poetry run python manage.py runserver`.

More information with what you can do with Django and manage.py can be found here https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-and-manage-py.
